This Code was derived from Marion Boynton's UAE unit project. 
You can change the steps on the x,y and z intervals to clearly see the pressure distributions in the DirectionalSinusoids file.
Other aspects that can be altered are the: 
- Positions of the transducers. - SrcePositions
- The speed of the waves - c
- The frequency - f


The delay file calculates the delay supplied to the transducers in order to focus the beams in particular directions.
